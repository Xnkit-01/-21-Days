# 📖 Day 6 – Nmap Learning  

## 🔍 What I Learned Today  

Today, I explored **Nmap (Network Mapper)**, one of the most powerful tools for network discovery and security auditing.  
I understood how Nmap helps in identifying hosts, open ports, running services, and even operating systems on a target.

## 🛠️ Key Concepts  

- **Host Discovery** – Find live systems in a network.  
- **Port Scanning** – Identify open, closed, or filtered ports.  
- **Service Detection** – Discover services and versions running on open ports.  
- **OS Fingerprinting** – Guess the operating system and network stack details.  
- **Scan Types** – Different scanning techniques like SYN, TCP connect, UDP, and stealth scans.

## 🧠 Key Takeaways  

- Nmap is not just a port scanner—it’s a **complete recon tool**.  
- The type of scan chosen impacts **speed**, **detail**, and **stealthiness**.  
- Responsible usage is important—only scan with **legal authorization**.

## 🚀 Next Steps  

- Learn to use **Nessus** for vulnerability assessment.  
- Explore **OpenVAS** as an open-source alternative to Nessus.  
- Compare results from **Nmap** with vulnerability scanners to understand how they complement each other.
