# 📘 Day 02 – Wireshark Practice

## 🕒 Session Details
- **Date:** 06 Sep 2025  
- **Activity:** Packet Capture & Analysis  
- **Duration:** Afternoon (Capture), Evening (Analysis & Documentation)  

## 🎯 Goals for Today
- Perform a packet capture on the Wi-Fi interface  
- Identify common protocols (DNS, HTTP, TCP)  
- Observe at least one TCP three-way handshake  
- Document findings clearly for portfolio  

## 📡 Capture Summary
- **Interface Used:** Wi-Fi  
- **Protocols Observed:** DNS, TCP, HTTP  
- **Notable Packets:**  
  - DNS query made to resolve `youtube.com`  
  - Successful TCP three-way handshake (SYN → SYN-ACK → ACK)  
  - HTTP GET request captured from client to server  

## 📝 Key Learnings
- Gained practice using **display filters** (`dns`, `http`, `tcp.handshake`).  
- Understood the flow of a **TCP handshake** and why it’s essential for connection establishment.  
- Observed how **DNS queries** and responses reveal domain-to-IP mappings.  

## 🔮 Next Steps (Day 03)
- Practice basic **Linux navigation commands** (`pwd`, `ls`, `cd`).  
- Work with **file and directory operations** (`touch`, `mkdir`, `cp`, `mv`, `rm`).  
- Explore **user and permission commands** (`whoami`, `chmod`, `chown`).
