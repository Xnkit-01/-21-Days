# 🧠 Hackers Manifesto 

I’m not here to break systems.  
I’m here to understand them, improve them, and teach others how to do the same.

Cybersecurity isn’t just my field—it’s my mindset.  
Every log I write, every tool I test, every entry I share is built with purpose.

I believe in ethical hacking, creative learning, and empowering beginners.  
My work blends structure with originality, discipline with curiosity.

This isn’t just code.  
It’s a commitment to clarity, growth, and community.
